**10/01/2025:** `dataretrieval` is pleased to offer a new module, `waterdata`, which gives users access USGS's modernized [Water Data APIs](https://api.waterdata.usgs.gov/). The Water Data API endpoints include daily values, instantaneous values, field measurements (modernized groundwater levels service), time series metadata, and discrete water quality data from the Samples database. Though there will be a period of overlap, the functions within `waterdata` will eventually replace the `nwis` module, which currently provides access to the legacy [NWIS Water Services](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/). More example workflows and functions coming soon. Check `help(waterdata)` for more information.

**09/03/2024:** The groundwater levels service has switched endpoints, and `dataretrieval` was updated accordingly in [`v1.0.10`](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/dataretrieval-python/releases/tag/v1.0.10). Older versions using the discontinued endpoint will return 503 errors for `nwis.get_gwlevels` or the `service='gwlevels'` argument. Visit [Water Data For the Nation](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/wdfn-waterservices-2024/) for more information.

**03/01/2024:** USGS data availability and format have changed on Water Quality Portal (WQP). Since March 2024, data obtained from WQP legacy profiles will not include new USGS data or recent updates to existing data. All USGS data (up to and beyond March 2024) are available using the new WQP beta services. You can access the beta services by setting `legacy=False` in the functions in the `wqp` module.
