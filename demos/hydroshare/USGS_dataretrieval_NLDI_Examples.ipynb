    "# USGS dataretrieval Python Package NLDI Data Access Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides examples of using the Python dataretrieval package to retrieve data from the United States  Geological Survey (USGS) Hydro Network-Linked Data Index (NLDI). The dataretrieval package provides a collection of functions to get data from the USGS Hydro Network-Linked Data Index (NLDI). For more information about NLDI visit the [USGS website](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/docs/nldi/about-nldi/index.html) describing NLDI or [this blog post](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/nldi-intro/) that covers basic features of the NLDI.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the [NLDI API documentation](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/api/nldi/swagger-ui/index.html): The NLDI is a search service that takes a watershed outlet identifier as a starting point, a navigation mode to perform, and the type of data desired in response to the request. It can provide geospatial representations of the navigation or linked data sources found along the navigation. It also has the ability to return landscape characteristics for the catchment the watershed outlet is contained in or the total upstream basin."

    "### Install the Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following code to install the package if it doesn't exist already within your Jupyter Python environment. Note the `nldi` option in the `dataretrieval` package installation. The default `dataretrieval` package installation does not support NLDI data access. You must run the dataretrieval install with the `nldi` option to ensure that you have the necessary capabilities. If you are running this notebook in the CUAHSI JuypyterHub server linked to HydroShare, you will want to run the following pip install command. The base `dataretrieval` package is already installed in the CUAHSI JupyterHub Python environment, but it does not include the NLDI option."

    "The dataretrieval package provides a number of functions to get data from the USGS NLDI. The following sections provide examples of how each of the available functions can be used\n",
    "\n",
    "* `get_basin()`: function used to get the upstream basin boundary for any feature indexed by NLDI.\n",
    "* `get_flowlines()`: function used to get upstream or downstream flowline data from NLDI.\n",
    "* `get_features()`: function used to retrieve information about features from any source indexed by NLDI.\n",
    "* `search()`: general function used to retrieve data from NLDI. Can be used in place of the functions listed above.\n",

You can use the `search()` function instead of the `get_basin()`, `get_flowlines()`, and `get_features()` functions described above. The search function returns data as a python dictionary. \n",

    "* **navigation_mode** (string): Navigation mode (allowed values are 'UM', 'DM', 'UT', 'DD'). 'UM' = Upstream on the mainstem. 'DM' = Downstream on the mainstem. 'UT' = Upstream with tributaries. 'DD' = Downstream with diversions.\n",
    "* **data_source** (string): The name of the NLDI data source.\n",
    "* **find** (string): The specific data type to search for. Allowed values are 'basin', 'flowlines', and 'feature' (default is 'features').\n",
    "* **comid** (integer): NHDPlus COMID (required if feature_source is not specified).\n",
    "* **lat** (float): Latitude (required if feature for a specific location is specified).\n",
    "* **long** (float): Longitude (required if feature for a specific location is specified).\n",
    "* **distance** (integer): Distance in kilometers (default is 50). This distance parameter dictates the distance to navigate."
