    "# Using the `waterdata` module to pull data from the USGS Water Data APIs\n",
    "The `waterdata` module will eventually replace the `nwis` module for accessing USGS water data. It leverages the [Water Data APIs](https://api.waterdata.usgs.gov/) to download metadata, daily values, and instantaneous values. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the specifics of this transition timeline are hazy, it is advised to switch to the new functions as soon as possible to reduce unexpected interruptions in your workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, please report any issues you encounter on our [Issues](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/dataretrieval-python/issues) page. If you have questions or need help, please reach out to us at comptools@usgs.gov."

    "## Prerequisite: Get your Water Data API key\n",
    "We highly suggest signing up for your own API key [here](https://api.waterdata.usgs.gov/signup/) to afford yourself higher rate limits and more reliable access to the data. If you opt not to register for an API key, then the number of requests you can make to the Water Data APIs is considerably lower, and if you share an IP address across users or workflows, you may hit those limits even faster. Luckily, registering for an API key is free and easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've copied your API key and saved it in a safe place, you can set it as an environment variable in your python script for the current session:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "os.environ['API_USGS_PAT'] = 'your_api_key_here'\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Note that the environment variable name is `API_USGS_PAT`, which stands for \"API USGS Personal Access Token\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like a more permanent repository-specific solution, you can use the `python-dotenv` package to read your API key from a `.env` file in your repository root directory, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!pip install python-dotenv # only run this line once to install the package in your environment\n",
    "from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "load_dotenv()  # this will load the environment variables from the .env file\n",
    "```\n",
    "Make sure your `.env` file contains the following line:\n",
    "```\n",
    "API_USGS_PAT=your_api_key_here\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also, do not commit your `.env` file to version control, as it contains sensitive information. You can add it to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits."

    "- `get_time_series_metadata()` - Timeseries metadata across monitoring locations, parameter codes, statistical codes, and more. Can be used to answer the question: what types of data are collected at my site(s) of interest and over what time period are/were they collected? \n",
    "- `get_latest_continuous()` - Latest instantaneous values for requested monitoring locations, parameter codes, statistical codes, and more.\n",
    "- `get_latest_daily()` - Latest daily values for requested monitoring locations, parameter codes, statistical codes, and more.\n",
    "- `get_field_measurements()` - Physically measured values (a.k.a discrete) of gage height, discharge, groundwater levels, and more for requested monitoring locations.\n",
