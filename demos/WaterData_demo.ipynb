If you opt not to register for an API key, then the number of requests you can make to the Water Data APIs is considerably lower, and if you share an IP address across users or workflows, you may hit those limits even faster. Luckily, registering for an API key is free and easy.\n",

    "- You'll notice that each of the data functions have many unique inputs you can specify. **DO NOT** specify too many! Specify *just enough* inputs to return what you need. But do not provide redundant geographical or parameter information as this may slow down your query and lead to errors.\n",
    "- Each function returns a Tuple, containing a dataframe and a Metadata class. If you have `geopandas` installed in your environment, the dataframe will be a `GeoDataFrame` with a geometry included. If you do not have `geopandas`, the dataframe will be a `pandas` dataframe with the geometry contained in a coordinates column. The Metadata object contains information about your query, like the query url.\n",
    "- If you do not want to return the `geometry` column, use the input `skip_geometry=True`.\n",
    "- All of these functions (except `get_samples()`) have a `limit` argument, which signifies the number of rows returned with each \"page\" of data. The Water Data APIs use paging to chunk up large responses and send data most efficiently to the requester. The `waterdata` functions collect the rows of data from each page and combine them into one final dataframe at the end. The default and maximum limit per page is 50,000 rows. In other words, if you request 100,000 rows of data from the database, it will return all the data in 2 pages, and each page counts as a \"request\" using your API key. If you were to change the argument to `limit=10000`, then each page returned would contain 10,000 rows, and it would take 10 requests/pages to return the total 100,000 rows. In general, there is no need to adjust the `limit` argument. However, if you are working with slow internet speeds, adjusting the `limit` argument may reduce chances of failures due to bandwidth.\n",
