    "In this section, examples of National Water Information System (NWIS) retrievals show how to get raw data into R. This data includes [site information](#site-information), measured [parameter information](#parameter-information), historical [daily values](#daily-data), [unit values](#unit-data) (which include real-time data but can also include other sensor data stored at regular time intervals), [water quality data](#water-quality-data), [groundwater level data](#groundwater-level-data), [peak flow data](#peak-flow-data), [rating curve data](#rating-curve-data),  [surface-water measurement data](#surface-water-measurement-data), [water use data](#water-use-data), and [statistics data](#statistics-data). The section [Embedded Metadata](#embedded-metadata) shows instructions for getting metadata that is attached to each returned data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The USGS organizes hydrologic data in a standard structure.  Streamgages are located throughout the United States, and each streamgage has a unique ID (referred in this document and throughout the `dataRetrieval` package as `siteNumber`).  Often (but not always), these ID's are 8 digits for surface-water sites and 15 digits for groundwater sites.  The first step to finding data is discovering this `siteNumber`. There are many ways to do this, one is the [National Water Information System: Mapper](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the `siteNumber` is known, the next required input for USGS data retrievals is the \"parameter code\".  This is a 5-digit code that specifies the measured parameter being requested.  For example, parameter code 00631 represents \"Nitrate plus nitrite, water, filtered, milligrams per liter as nitrogen\", with units of \"mg/l as N\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Not every station will measure all parameters. A short list of commonly measured parameters is shown in Table 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TODO table here\n",
    "\n",
    "Two output columns that may not be obvious are \"srsname\" and \"casrn\". Srsname stands for \"Substance Registry Services\". More information on the srs name can be found [here](http://ofmpub.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/substreg/home/overview/home.do).\n",
    "\n",
    "Casrn stands for \"Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number\". More information on CAS can be found [here](http://www.cas.org/content/chemical-substances/faqs).\n",
    "\n",
    "For unit values data (sensor data measured at regular time intervals such as 15 minutes or hourly), knowing the parameter code and `siteNumber` is enough to make a request for data.  For most variables that are measured on a continuous basis, the USGS also stores the historical data as daily values.  These daily values are statistical summaries of the continuous data, e.g. maximum, minimum, mean, or median. The different statistics are specified by a 5-digit statistics code.  \n",

Any value that cannot be converted to a number will be reported as NA in this package (not including remark code columns), unless the user sets an argument convertType to FALSE.
