# dataretrieval: Download hydrologic data

## What is dataretrieval?
`dataretrieval` was created to simplify the process of loading hydrologic data into the Python environment.
Like the original R version [`dataRetrieval`](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/dataRetrieval),
it is designed to retrieve the major data types of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) hydrology
data that are available on the Web, as well as data from the Water
Quality Portal (WQP), which currently houses water quality data from the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA), and USGS. Direct USGS data is obtained from a service called the
National Water Information System (NWIS).

Note that the python version is not a direct port of the original: it attempts to reproduce the functionality of the R package,
though its organization and interface often differ.

If there's a hydrologic or environmental data portal that you'd like dataretrieval to 
work with, raise it as an [issue](https://github.com/USGS-python/dataretrieval/issues).

Here's an example using `dataretrieval` to retrieve data from the National Water Information System (NWIS).

```python
# first import the functions for downloading data from NWIS
import dataretrieval.nwis as nwis

# specify the USGS site code for which we want data.
site = '03339000'


# get instantaneous values (iv)
df = nwis.get_record(sites=site, service='iv', start='2017-12-31', end='2018-01-01')

# get water quality samples (qwdata)
df2 = nwis.get_record(sites=site, service='qwdata', start='2017-12-31', end='2018-01-01')

# get basic info about the site
df3 = nwis.get_record(sites=site, service='site')
```
Services available from NWIS include:
- instantaneous values (iv)
- daily values (dv)
- statistics (stat)
- site info (site)
- discharge peaks (peaks)
- discharge measurements (measurements)
* water quality samples (qwdata)

To access the full functionality available from NWIS web services, nwis.get record appends any additional kwargs into the REST request. For example
```python
nwis.get_record(sites='03339000', service='dv', start='2017-12-31', parameterCd='00060')
```
will download daily data with the parameter code 00060 (discharge).

## Accessing the "Internal" NWIS
If you're connected to the USGS network, dataretrieval call pull from the internal (non-public) NWIS interface.
Most dataretrieval functions pass kwargs directly to NWIS's REST API, which provides simple access to internal data; simply specify "access='3'".
For example
```python
nwis.get_record(sites='05404147',service='iv', start='2021-01-01', end='2021-3-01', access='3')
```

## Quick start

dataretrieval can be installed using pip:
	
    $ python3 -m pip install -U dataretrieval

or conda:

    $ conda install -c conda-forge dataretrieval

More examples of use are include in [`demos`](https://github.com/USGS-python/dataretrieval/tree/master/demos).

## Package Support
The Water Mission Area of the USGS supports the development and maintenance of `dataretrieval`
and most likely further into the future.
Resources are available primarily for maintenance and responding to user questions.
Priorities on the development of new features are determined by the `dataretrieval` development team.
