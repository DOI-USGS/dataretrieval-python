NWRSFWS_WQX,"National Wildlife Refuge System, Fish and Wildlife Service",R5NWRS_WQ,"USFWS Northeast Region, National Wildlife Refuge System, Water Quality Inventory and Monitoring","Four reasons for including a water quality and water quantity monitoring system in the I & M Initiative are stated in the USFWS (2013a) Inventory and Monitoring 7-year plan:   1) Most refuges were set aside for wildlife resources that depend on water. Trust species (interjurisdictional fish and many migratory bird species) rely on aquatic habitats. We must have a basic understanding of the water quality and quantity across the System to better inform current and future water management activities at the station and landscape scale.  2) We need this information to meet USFWS basic mandates - such as ""Acquire, under State law, water rights that are needed for refuge purposes"".  3) Water availability is expected to change radically with climate change and we need to be able to document the current quality, quantity, timing and distribution of our water resources.  4) Monitoring data informs refuge management and allows us to protect Refuge System water supplies to fulfill refuge purposes and the System mission.  Goals and Objectives of the Protocol Framework  Goal 1: Through application of the protocol framework, high quality data are obtained as the basis for making informed and accurate decisions on managing and protecting water quality on refuge lands.   Goal 2: The protocol framework must be flexible to address common problems across all refuges and still allow individual refuges to address unique problems and issues.  Objective 1: The protocol framework will address the broad information needs common to most Region 5 refuges.   Approach: The focus of monitoring will be nutrients, which Lingenfelser et al. (2013) cited as the most frequent concern on Northeast Region refuges and was identified as a major stressor in the EPA (2013a) National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA). The protocol will address water quality changes in streams entering and exiting refuges to ensure that refuge management actions do not negatively impact streams. We recommend a strategy that assesses the most common threats on all refuges through the protocol framework and allows site specific concerns to be addressed in the individual refuge protocols.   Objective 3: Information gathered in the surveys will be compatible with those gathered by state and federal programs and will be easily shared.      Approach: Utilize  NPS-STORET such that researchers and state and federal agencies will be able to merge data sets and make inferences about water quality issues on a larger geographical scale than the refuge boundaries.","Targeted - A targeted sample is where a ""sample"" of the subject matter, be that people, plants/animals etc is selected using certain criteria, i.e. pregnant mothers between the ages of 25-30.

Historical specific conductance data obtained through discrete sampling shows that during winter months (December to March), levels of specific conductance in non-tidal freshwater streams increase significantly during and after significant snowfall events.

The two specific objectives of this program and the questions that frame these general monitoring objectives are: 
Objective 1: Detect changes over time in the status of physical (e.g., stream flow and stage), chemical (e.g., pH and DO), and nutrient status (e.g., nitrogen or chlorophyll a) of the lakes, ponds, and streams in NETN parks.
Question 1: What is the natural range of temporal variability of the selected metrics of the vital signs for NETN lakes, ponds, and streams?
Question 2: Are the selected metrics of the vital signs outside the range of natural variability? 
	Question 3: Are the selected metrics of the vital signs exceeding thresholds set by states as a part of their legal mandate under the Clean Water Act? 
Objective 2: Ensure the early detection of aquatic invasive plants in the lakes, ponds and streams of NETN parks and alert park and state environmental managers of any new incidences of aquatic invasive species to facilitate a rapid response. 
Question 1: What non-native invasive aquatic plant species currently exist in the lakes, ponds and streams of NETN parks?

11NPSWRD_WQX,National Park Service Water Resources Division,MORR0002,Morristown National Historical Park Watershed Study Phase II,"A major part of Morristown National Historical Park exists in what was once a highly-rural area of western Morris County, New Jersey.  This relatively small park is of great historical and ecological importance to the people of New Jersey and our nation.  Unfortunately, this highly prized parkland no longer benefits from the low-intensity use that was once characteristic of the lands surrounding the park.  A rapid suburbanization has taken place along its boundaries during the past few decades, and there appears to be little chance for any major curtailment.  These changes in land use threaten the natural resources of this park.

The National Park Service has correctly recognized this threat to the integrity, preservation and public use of Morristown National Historical Park and has sought to establish background or baseline data on the natural resources within the park?s boundary.  In keeping with this recognized need, the Park Service contracted Associated Ecologists to conduct an evaluation of the park?s aquatic resources.  That study has been completed and a final report was submitted (Mele and Mele 1983).

One of the shortcomings in the study by Associated Ecologists was the benthic macroinvertebrate survey.  The number of samples taken was too few, quantitative methods were not used and identification was rarely to genus.  Benthic macroinvertebrates, especially the larval aquatic insects, are one of several groups found in lotic environments that have been used to classify streams (Persoone 1979; NCDNR 1986) and to monitor water quality (Hawkes 1979).

The objectives of this study were to: (1) establish, reconfirm or extend baseline data on selected parameters of water quality; (2) measure seasonal concentrations of aluminum in the stream waters and in the soil; (3) determine the seasonal fecal coliform/fecal streptococcus ratios in the major streams; (4) perform a comprehensive and quantitative survey of the benthic macroinvertebrates; and (5) identify the macrophytes and benthic algae associated with the park?s streams.",,N,,https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/providers/STORET/organizations/11NPSWRD_WQX/projects/MORR0002/files,
11NPSWRD_WQX,National Park Service Water Resources Division,MORR0001,Water Resources Assessment and Inventory by Mele and Mele,"Morristown National Historical Park is located in western Morris County, New Jersey.  Part of the park lies within the city limits of Morristown, however, a major portion of park land is situated outside the city limits in a rural, residential area. Historically, this natural area provided the winter encampment site for the troops of General George Washington's army in 1779-1780.  Because of the historical importance of the area, the staff of the National Park Service has become increasingly concerned about the extensive development of the land surrounding the park and the effect of that development on Park flora and fauna.  Ehrenfeld (1982) provides a detailed history and analysis of land-use within the Park through a series of maps which trace the history of clearing and abandonment of specific fields.  Additionally, data exists (Ehrenfeld, 1977) which shows the Park to include a wide variety of forest stands with respect to age and species composition.  As a result of these floral studies the next logical step to be taken to insure the perpetuation of this valuable natural and historical area seemed to be to provide base-line data to determine the physical and chemical water quality characteristics at selected sampling locations within Morristown National Historical Park.  Commencement of this study began on October 16, 1982 with a monthly field monitoring program for water quality which included dissolved oxygen, temperature, conductivity, pH, stream velocity and discharge measurements. Also, a seasonal water chemistry sampling program was begun on November 11, 1982.  A total of 15 water chemistry parameters was quantitatively determined for each monitoring station. From these data an assessment of the general hydrological features of surface water characteristics within the park can be made.  The present study is offered to establish baseline data in each of the studied parameters as an attempt to determine the impact, if any, of future development or environme",,N,,https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/providers/STORET/organizations/11NPSWRD_WQX/projects/MORR0001/files,
